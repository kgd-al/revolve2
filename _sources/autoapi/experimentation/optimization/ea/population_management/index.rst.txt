.. py:function:: generational(old_genotypes: list[Genotype], old_fitnesses: list[Fitness], new_genotypes: list[Genotype], new_fitnesses: list[Fitness], selection_function: Callable[[int, list[Genotype], list[Fitness]], list[int]]) -> tuple[list[int], list[int]]

   Select `len(old_genotypes)` individuals using the provided selection function from only the offspring(`new_genotypes`).

   :param old_genotypes: Genotypes of the individuals in the parent population. Ignored and only here for function signature compatibility with `steady_state`.
   :param old_fitnesses: Fitnesses of the individuals in the parent population. Ignored and only here for function signature compatibility with `steady_state`.
   :param new_genotypes: Genotypes of the individuals from the offspring.
   :param new_fitnesses: Fitnesses of the individuals from the offspring.
   :param selection_function: Function that selects n individuals from a population based on their genotype and fitness. (n, genotypes, fitnesses) -> indices
   :returns: (always empty list of indices of selected old individuals, indices of selected individuals from offspring).


.. py:function:: steady_state(old_genotypes: list[Genotype], old_fitnesses: list[Fitness], new_genotypes: list[Genotype], new_fitnesses: list[Fitness], selection_function: Callable[[int, list[Genotype], list[Fitness]], numpy.typing.NDArray[numpy.float_]]) -> tuple[list[int], list[int]]

   Select `len(old_genotypes)` individuals using the provided selection function from combined set of old and new individuals.

   :param old_genotypes: Genotypes of the individuals in the parent population.
   :param old_fitnesses: Fitnesses of the individuals in the parent population.
   :param new_genotypes: Genotypes of the individuals from the offspring.
   :param new_fitnesses: Fitnesses of the individuals from the offspring.
   :param selection_function: Function that selects n individuals from a population based on their genotype and fitness. (n, genotypes, fitnesses) -> indices
   :returns: (indices of selected individuals from parent population, indices of selected individuals from offspring).
