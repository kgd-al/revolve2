   Bases: :py:obj:`simulation.scene._joint.Joint`

   .. autoapi-inheritance-diagram:: simulation.scene._joint_hinge.JointHinge
      :parts: 1

   A hinge joint, also known as revolute joint.

   Rotates around a single axis.

   .. py:attribute:: axis
      :type: pyrr.Vector3

      Directional vector the joint rotates about.


   .. py:attribute:: range
      :type: float

      Rotation range of the joint in radians.

      How much it can rotate to each side, in radians.
      So double this is the complete range of motion.


   .. py:attribute:: effort
      :type: float

      Maximum effort the joint can exert, in newton-meter.


   .. py:attribute:: velocity
      :type: float

      Maximum velocity of the joint, in radian per second.


   .. py:attribute:: armature
      :type: float

      Armature of the joint.

      This represents the inertia of the motor itself when nothing is attached.


   .. py:attribute:: pid_gain_p
      :type: float

      Proportional gain of the pid position controller.


   .. py:attribute:: pid_gain_d
      :type: float

      Derivative gain of the pid position controller.
